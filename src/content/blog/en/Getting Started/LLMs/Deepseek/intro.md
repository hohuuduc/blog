## About Deepseek

Deepseek is a family of large language models focused on reasoning-heavy tasks. This introductory note summarises the main variants and key differentiators.

### Model lineup

- **Deepseek-V2** balances speed and precision for general workloads.
- **Deepseek-Coder** specialises in code generation and review scenarios.
- **Deepseek-Math** is tuned for quantitative reasoning and symbolic manipulation.

### Why it matters

Vendors are increasingly combining Deepseek checkpoints with lightweight adapters to solve domain-specific problems. Capturing the configuration in a reproducible way helps teams compare deployments quickly.
