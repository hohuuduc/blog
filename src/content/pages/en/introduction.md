## Overview

This blog is built to record my learning journey and share knowledge around modern web development.

### Core Technologies

- **Astro** handles static builds and flexible routing.
- **Angular** delivers a rich, interactive UI.
- **TypeScript** brings safety across the entire codebase.

## Key Features

1. Write posts in Markdown, then the system renders them as web pages.
2. Clear navigation with a sidebar list of pages and per-page table of contents.
3. Tweak the theme directly via the Settings dialog in the top-right corner.

### Content Structure

Posts are grouped into navigation sections: *docs*, *information*, *playground*, and *other* so you can explore content easily.
